For several reasons: <ol><li>To the best of our knowledge at this stage no other product scans Slack messages for risks.</li><li>It is always better to identify a risk early (e.g. when it first appears in Slack) vs. late (e.g. when downloaded to your PC or phone).</li><li>Many users access Slack from several devices. A malicious content can put all devices at risk.</li></ol>"

These services collect threat information from multiple sources and provide up to date information. When D<small>BOT</small> sees an IP address or URL in a message it automatically queries these services to find out whether the address is known to be bad."

            a: "We use services that continuously index malware as well as scan files for trojans, viruses and other malware. When D<small>BOT</small> recognizes a posting of a file in a Slack message, it checks the file and warns you if a known malware is detected."

            q: "What do I do if D<small>BOT</small> issues a warning about a URL/IP address/File?",
            a: "You need to exercise good judgement. It is advisable not to follow a link that is known to be malicious and not to download a malicious file to any of your devices. It is also advisable to ask the person who posted a malicious file to delete it from Slack to prevent other users from accidentally downloading it."

          {
            q: "Do I need to scan all channels?",
            a: "We recommend that you scan all channels, all private groups and all direct messages as malware can appear anywhere. However, you do have the choice of selecting particular channels if you wish to limit the protection provided by D<small>BOT</small> to these channels only."
